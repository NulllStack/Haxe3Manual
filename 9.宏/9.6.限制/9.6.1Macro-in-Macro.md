# 9.6.1Macro-in-Macro

Build macros cannot be invoked from a macro context. This means it is impossible to use a macro to create a class which will provide build macros for other classes.



##### [since Haxe 4.0.0](https://haxe.org/manual/macro-limitations-macro-in-macro.html#since-haxe-4.0.0)

It is also disallowed to invoke expression macros in a macro context.

> Prior to Haxe 4, using expression macros inside a macro context was possible. Support was primarily dropped because such code would cause issues with the compiler cache.
