# 4.4.4.Override

访问修饰符 override 要求被修饰的字段声明也同时出现在父类（第2.3.2节）中。它的目的是确保类的作者意识到 override 因为这不能总是被明显的在庞大的类层级中。此外，如果字段修饰了override关键字而实际上没有重写任何东西（例如由于字段名的拼写错误导致）会引发一个错误。

> The access modiﬁer override is required when a ﬁeld is declared which also exists on a parent class(2.3.2). Its purpose is to ensure that the author of a class is aware of the override as this may not always be obvious in large class hierarchies. Likewise, having override on a ﬁeld which does not actually override anything (e.g. due to a misspelled ﬁeld name) triggers an error.

重载字段的效果在重载方法（第4.3.1节）详述。这个修饰符只允许用于方法（第4.3节）字段。

> The effects of overriding ﬁelds are detailed in Overriding Methods (Section 4.3.1). This modiﬁer is only allowed on method (4.3) ﬁelds.
