# 10.1.2.Unicode



##### [since Haxe 4.0.0](https://haxe.org/manual/std-String-unicode.html#since-haxe-4.0.0)

All Haxe targets except Neko support Unicode in strings by default. The [compile-time define](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-condition-compilation.html) `target.unicode` is set on targets where Unicode is supported.

A string in Haxe code represents a valid sequence of Unicode codepoints. Due to differing internal representations of strings across targets, only the basic multilingual plane (BMP) is supported consistently: every BMP Unicode codepoint corresponds to exactly one string character.

It is still possible to work with strings including non-BMP characters on all targets without having to manually decode surrogate pairs by using the [Unicode iterators API](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/iterators/StringIteratorUnicode.html) provided in the standard library.
