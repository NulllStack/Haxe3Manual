# 10.1.3.Encoding

On some targets, the internal representation is UTF-16, which means that non-BMP Unicode codepoints are represented using surrogate pairs. The [compile-time define](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-condition-compilation.html) `target.utf16` is set when the target uses UTF-16 internally.



##### [Null-bytes in strings](https://haxe.org/manual/std-String-encoding.html#null-bytes-in-strings)



Some Haxe targets disallow null-bytes (Unicode codepoint 0) in strings. Additionally, some Haxe core APIs assume a null-byte terminates strings. To consistently deal with binary data, including null-bytes, use the [`haxe.io.Bytes`](https://api.haxe.org/haxe/io/Bytes.html) API.
