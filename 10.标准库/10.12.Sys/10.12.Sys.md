# 10.12.Sys

The majority of Haxe targets are so-called "sys" targets. This means the targets have access to system APIs such as the filesystem, networking, threads, and more. The only non-sys targets supported by Haxe are Flash, JavaScript, and ActionScript 3, although JavaScript can support sys APIs when running under Node.js runtime.
